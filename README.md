# ESG Score Analysis on Stock Performance

## Overview
This project is a personal exercise using **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** and **R** to analyze:
1. The effect of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores on stock performance.
2. What factors contribute to an ESG score.

The datasets used in this analysis are:
- [Mutual Funds and ETFs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/mutual-funds-and-etfs)
- [S&P 500 ESG Risk Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pritish509/s-and-p-500-esg-risk-ratings)

## Key Findings
### A. ESG and Stock Performance
- **Conclusion**: In the long run, having a high ESG score doesn't significantly affect stock performance.

### B. Impact of Workers on ESG Scores
- **Observation**: The number of workers has a **mediocre** impact on ESG scores.

### C. ESG and Sectors
- **Insight**: When isolating by specific sectors, the relationship between sectors and ESG scores is **negligible**.
    - This suggests that no particular sector excels or underperforms based on ESG scores.

## My Opinion
Based on the findings:
> It seems that ESG is primarily a **marketing tactic**, rather than a reliable measure of long-term stock performance or sector-specific success.
