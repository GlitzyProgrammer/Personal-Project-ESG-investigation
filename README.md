This is a personal exercise in using Jupyter Notebook(Python) and R to do analysis of what ESG(Environmental Social Governance) Score effects on stock performance and
what contributes to a score. Using two data sets from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/mutual-funds-and-etfs" and 
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pritish509/s-and-p-500-esg-risk-ratings"

As of now, my conclusion is that 
A) In the long run having a high ESG score doesn't really matter for stock performance\n 
B) The amount of workers has a mediocre impact on ESG scores 
C) Isolating by specific sectors it reveals that the relationship between the sectors and ESG is neglagant, suggesting no sectors do particularly well or badly with ESG scores. 

Thus,
In my opinion, it seems that ESG is purely a marking tactic.
